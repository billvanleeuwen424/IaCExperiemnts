# Gitlab Server Infrastructure as Code

## Description

A fun little experiment in which a Gitlab server is setup with only a few keystrokes and password entries.

This was my first ever use of [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/). It is not an optimized project at all, and could very much use some future improvements. Nonetheless, it was super fun to dip my toes into the IaC world.
